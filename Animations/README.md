# Tools Scripting Final Task

## 4. Rigid animation for more than object per frame

First we have modified our maxscript code so now it will create a file with the animations of all the objects of the scene. Also we changed the file adding the total number of frames to known where the next animation begins.

## TODO GIFS

Then we modified the animation parser so it will accept more than one animation from one file.
