# Tools Scripting Final Task

## 3. Build a cinematic,Track Camera

First we created an scritp that gives the spline positions, so we can use it with our camera tracks.

Then we added "viewtrack" property to the camera. It is the entity which the camera automaticaly will target.

Finally we mix everything and we have added an option to make the camera jump between splines.
